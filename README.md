## Who is the Hai Form library for?
The purpose of the Hai Form library is to provide a basic solution for the most common form field needs. The intention is to cover as many fields as possible so that web developers do not have to use a large number of external libraries when creating forms. 

At the same time however, it is not planned to address any field type very deeply. There is a huge number of specialized libraries that focus specifically on particular field types, and the Hai Form library does not aim to try to outdo these libraries. 

So if you are happy with a somewhat more basic solution (such as text masks) and don't need any more complex functionality for your forms, the Hai Form library may be ideal for you, otherwise I recommend taking a look at many great libraries listed below that served as inspiration for the Hai Form library.
